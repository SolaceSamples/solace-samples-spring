## Solace PubSub+ Spring

At Solace we support integrating our PubSub+ Event Broker with Spring in several different ways to promote the ease of building event driven applications. This repository contains code samples for doing so, but it's best to clone the repo and then follow the step by step tutorials here: [tutorials home page](https://solace.com/samples/solace-samples-spring/)
* Spring Boot Autoconfigure
* Spring Cloud Stream
* Spring Integration (JMS) [Coming soon!]

## Access a PubSub+ Service

The Spring Tutorials require that you have access to a PubSub+ Service. You can quickly set one up for FREE by following [these instructions](https://solace.com/try-it-now/)

## Contents

This repository contains code and matching tutorial walk throughs for different basic scenarios. It is best to view the associated [tutorials home page](https://dev.solace.com/samples/solace-samples-spring/).

## Prerequisites

Install the data model
``` bash
cd spring-samples-datamodel
mvn clean install
```

## Running the Samples

To try individual samples, go into the project directory and run the sample using maven.

``` bash
cd cloud-streams-sink
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To try running individual samples with distributed tracing enabled you can use the `run.sh` script in the `cloud-stream-processor`, `cloud-stream-sink`, or `cloud-stream-source` projects. 
* First ensure distributed tracing is enabled on your broker and you have an open telemetry collector setup to receive your traces. More info [in docs](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Distributed-Tracing/Distributed-Tracing-Overview.htm)
* Then go into the project you'd like to run and execute the `run.sh` script! 

## Exploring the Samples

### Setting up your preferred IDE

Using a modern Java IDE provides cool productivity features like auto-completion, on-the-fly compilation, assisted refactoring and debugging which can be useful when you're exploring the samples and even modifying the samples. Follow the steps below for your preferred IDE.

This repository uses Maven projects. If you would like to import the projects into your favorite IDE you should be able to import them as Maven Projects. For examples, in eclipse choose "File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Next -> Browse for your repo -> Select which projects -> Click Finish"
