# cloud-stream-processor - Using Spring Cloud Stream Processor

The `ConvertFtoCProcessor` application is a Spring Boot application that processes incoming sensor readings (object of type *SensorReading*). It uses a Spring Cloud Stream processor function to convert the temperature value from Fahrenheit to Celsius and produces a new *SensorReading* with the temperature in Celsius.

## Requirements

To run this sample, you will need to have installed:

- Java 17 or Above

## Code Tour

In the `ConvertFtoCProcessor` application, review the processor code which converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

```java
@Bean
public Function<SensorReading, SensorReading> convertFtoC() {
    return reading -> {
        log.info("Received: " + reading);

        double temperatureCelsius = (reading.getTemperature().doubleValue() - 32) * 5 / 9;
        reading.setTemperature(temperatureCelsius);
        reading.setBaseUnit(SensorReading.BaseUnit.CELSIUS);

        log.info("Sending: " + reading);

        return reading;
    };
}
```

- The function receives a `SensorReading` object, converts its temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and returns the modified `SensorReading` object.

## Running the application

Make sure to update the Solace Broker connection details with the appropriate host, msgVpn, client username, and password in `application.yml`.

```sh
cd cloud-stream-processor
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
This will start the Spring Boot application.

Using Solace Try-Me UI, publish an event on the topic ```sensor/temperature/fahrenheit```, with the following payload
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-05T14:48:00.000+00:00",
  "sensorID": "sensor123",
  "temperature": 98.6,
  "baseUnit": "FAHRENHEIT"
}
```

You can see the processor function converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and logs the received and sent sensor readings.

In the terminal, you can see the received and sent sensor readings.
